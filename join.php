                                            WSBF has an open door policy for any Clemson University student with a 2.2 GPA or better. University employees and members of the community may also become members of the WSBF staff. First semester freshmen and transfer students can also become members, but will have to meet eligibility requirements after the first grading period.

                                            Once all of the previous procedures have been completed, an intern may take his/her on-air test with a member of Senior Staff. The intern should email the Chief Announcer when he/she is ready to schedule a time to take the test. An intern may not take the on-air test with a member of Senior Staff with whom he/she did sit-in or board time. The on-air test covers all WSBF rules, FCC rules, and knowledge of how to properly operate all control room equipment. After passing the test, interns must make a one time dues payment of $20 and sign all applicable forms to become a DJ. The new DJ	may then pick a show time, for which he/she will be responsible immediately.

                                        WSBF offers a broadcast training course at the start of each semester that is open to all students, faculty, staff members, and community members. There is a one-time dues fee of $20 upon completion of training; procedures for which are outlined on the next page.

                                        Once all of the previous procedures have been completed, an intern may take his/her on-air test with a member of Senior Staff.

                                        <h3>Training Procedures</h3>
                                        <p>
                                        At the beginning of every semester, WSBF holds an intern drop-in for people interested in becoming involved with the station. This drop-in is held on Tuesday at 8pm on the third full week of classes. After this drop-in, all attendees are invited back to begin training to become a WSBF DJ. Anyone who wishes to become a WSBF DJ must complete the process outlined below.

                                        Once all of the previous procedures have been completed, an intern may take his/her on-air test with a member of Senior Staff. The intern should email the Chief Announcer when he/she is ready to schedule a time to take the test. An intern may not take the on-air test with a member of Senior Staff with whom he/she did sit-in or board time. The on-air test covers all WSBF rules, FCC rules, and knowledge of how to properly operate all control room equipment. After passing the test, interns must make a one time dues payment of $20 and sign all applicable forms to become a DJ. The new DJ	may then pick a show time, for which he/she will be responsible immediately.

                                        <h3>Written Test</h3>
                                        <p>

                                        Before becoming an intern, all prospects will be issued an up to date copy of the WSBF Handbook. At 8pm on the Wednesday and Thursday following the intern drop-in, the Chief Announcer will go over the handbook with them and point out important information, rules, and procedures. After this they must take a written test on this information, on which they	must score at least 85%. Those who score lower than 85% may request to retake the test again a later date. Those who score 85% and above may begin their internship at WSBF.

                                        Once all of the previous procedures have been completed, an intern may take his/her on-air test with a member of Senior Staff. The intern should email the Chief Announcer when he/she is ready to schedule a time to take the test. An intern may not take the on-air test with a member of Senior Staff with whom he/she did sit-in or board time.

After passing the test, interns must make a one time dues payment of $20 and sign all applicable forms to become a DJ. The new DJ	may then pick a show time, for which he/she will be responsible immediately.

                                        Interns should supply the Chief Announcer with a list of times they are available for training, in order of preference. The Chief Announcer will use this information to create a schedule of DJs for each intern to train under and email it to the interns and full staff. Interning will begin the Monday after the intern drop-in. Each intern will be assigned to two DJs. For	the first two weeks of training, the intern should report to the first DJ and for the second two weeks of training, the intern should report to the second DJ. An intern must get at least 3 hours of sit-in time and 3 hours of board time for a total of at least 6 hours of training. The intern may get at most 1.5 hours of their sit-in time and 1.5 hours of their board time from a single DJ. An intern must have at least 1.5 hours of sit-in time with a DJ before they can begin their board time with that	DJ, unless the intern has already completed all 3 of their sit-in hours with at least two different DJs. Interns may train with DJs other than those with which they were scheduled to train, so long as the DJ does not have more than two interns at a time. Interns must have the DJ fill out their intern training form and sign off on all training hours completed; they must also complete the training check list. All training must be completed by the sixth Sunday after interning begins, unless an acceptable excuse is given. In addition to completing their training, an intern must complete two CD reviews (described later in this handbook) before they will be allowed to take their on-air test. Interns must complete their hours and pass the on-air	test within two semesters of taking their written test. For every successive semester after two, an additional two hours of sit-in time and board time (four hours total) must be completed before a test can be administered.

                                        Once all of the previous procedures have been completed, an intern may take his/her on-air test with a member of Senior Staff. The intern should email the Chief Announcer when he/she is ready to schedule a time to take the test. An intern may not take the on-air test with a member of Senior Staff with whom he/she did sit-in or board time. The on-air test covers all WSBF rules, FCC rules, and knowledge of how to properly operate all control room equipment. After passing the test, interns must make a one time dues payment of $20 and sign all applicable forms to become a DJ. The new DJ	may then pick a show time, for which he/she will be responsible immediately.
